## 🧠 Agent Maturity Roadmap: From Level 0 to Level 5

| Level | Agent Capability | Strategic Focus | Key Gaps to Address |
|-------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Level 0** | **Prompt-only agents** | Static LLM wrappers with hardcoded prompts | No memory, no tools, no orchestration |
| **Level 1** | **Tool-augmented agents** | Basic function calling (e.g., search, calculator) | No planning, no control flow, brittle logic |
| **Level 2** | **Orchestrated agents** | Task decomposition, tool routing, retries | No memory, no governance, no modularity |
| **Level 3** | **Memory-enabled agents** | Working + long-term memory, context-aware | No personalization, no audit, no lifecycle |
| **Level 4** | **Multi-agent systems** | Planner + executor agents, collaboration | No control plane, no cost/compliance guardrails |
| **Level 5** | **Self-evolving agents** | Reflection, learning, adaptation, optimization | No feedback loops, no CI/CD, no policy engine |

## 🧩 Curated Steps to Progress Through Each Level

### 🔹 Level 0 → Level 1: Tool-Augmented Agents
- ✅ Define callable tools (OpenAPI, LangChain schema)
- ✅ Build tool registry with metadata (latency, cost, domain)
- ✅ Enable basic function calling via LLM orchestration
- 🔧 Missing: sandboxing, error handling, fallback logic

---

### 🔹 Level 1 → Level 2: Orchestrated Agents
- ✅ Introduce orchestration layer (LangChain, Semantic Kernel, custom)
- ✅ Implement control flow: retries, branching, conditional logic
- ✅ Modularize agent logic into reusable components
- 🔧 Missing: agent registry, lifecycle management, versioning

---

### 🔹 Level 2 → Level 3: Memory-Enabled Agents
- ✅ Add working memory (session context, scratchpad)
- ✅ Add long-term memory (vector DB + structured store)
- ✅ Enable memory retrieval and update logic
- 🔧 Missing: memory governance, user-specific context, ABAC policies

---

### 🔹 Level 3 → Level 4: Multi-Agent Systems
- ✅ Define agent roles (planner, executor, verifier, retriever)
- ✅ Enable inter-agent communication and task handoff
- ✅ Introduce agent registry and ownership model
- 🔧 Missing: unified control plane, IAM, audit trail, cost guardrails

---

### 🔹 Level 4 → Level 5: Self-Evolving Agents
- ✅ Add reflection loop (evaluate, revise, retry)
- ✅ Integrate feedback signals (user ratings, success metrics)
- ✅ Enable agent tuning via CI/CD (prompt updates, tool swaps)
- ✅ Launch AgentOps dashboard (success rate, hallucination, cost)
- 🔧 Missing: policy engine, rollback, canary testing, compliance hooks

## 🛡️ Cross-Cutting Enablers (Must Be Curated Throughout)

| Enabler | Description | Owner |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Unified Control Plane** | Agent registry, deployment, monitoring | AI Platform |
| **IAM & Policy Engine** | RBAC/ABAC, tool/data access, audit | Security & Compliance |
| **AgentOps** | Observability, debugging, performance tracking | AI Ops |
| **CI/CD for Agents** | GitOps-style deployment, rollback, versioning | DevOps |
| **LOB Templates** | Domain-specific agent blueprints | AI Strategy |

---

## 🚀 Final Outcome: Self-Evolving Agents

These agents will:
- Learn from feedback and revise their strategies
- Adapt tool usage and memory based on context
- Collaborate across roles and domains
- Operate within governed, compliant, and cost-aware boundaries
